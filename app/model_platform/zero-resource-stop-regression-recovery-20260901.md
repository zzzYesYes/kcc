# Zero-resource Stop regression recovery — 2026-09-01

## Regression chain

Changing `qwen38-27b` from the Ray Composition to a dedicated stopped
Composition exposed three contracts that still assumed stopped runtime
resources remained present:

1. `function-patch-and-transform` rejected `resources: []`, leaving the XR
   `Synced=False`;
2. the Running capacity gate required the deleted cache Job to be Complete and
   the Start/Stop auto-merge policies did not project Composition changes;
3. the production XRD required `spec.runtime.serving`, while the production
   RuntimeProfile, request files and Backstage request generator still omitted
   it.

## Recovered contract

- Stopped retains only `qwen38-27b-status`, a status-only ConfigMap declaring
  runtime/cache disabled and NPU requested zero.
- RayService, RayCluster, Pods, Services, PVC, cache Job and NetworkPolicy are
  removed while stopped.
- Start changes both Composition references from
  `modeldeployment-stopped-v1alpha1` to
  `modeldeployment-qwen38-ray-v1alpha1`; Stop performs the inverse transition.
- The capacity gate validates the stopped XR, immutable profile/cache/artifact
  contract, Kubernetes claims and physical NPU telemetry. It no longer requires
  a cache Job that is intentionally absent while stopped.
- The Ray Composition recreates the cache PVC/Job. Head and worker Pods retain
  the existing READY-file init gate before model startup.
- `runtime.serving` is now present in the certified RuntimeProfile, production
  requests, JSON schemas, validator and Backstage request generator.

## Production state

- Tekton `validate-model-platform-config` generation: 18 after installing the
  retained-PV reclaimer task.
- Running Window remains explicitly open for the user-approved acceptance.
- Backstage image:
  `0.6.1.2-serving-contract-hotfix-20260901@sha256:48ec0a673d565dc93fa1cd3460cc91727da99b295d964c2b02e4971fc3d5a0ac`.
- PR #32 passed all six tasks and merged as
  `5b37fae62493857139a535541051760dd63b8fca`.
- Argo accepted the corrected Running request with `runtime.serving` and the XR
  entered Running/Synced/Ready. Cache, Ray and Pod resources were recreated.
- The retained PV was safely rebound without deleting its local cache. The
  cache Job completed and fresh Ray head/worker Pods entered Running on
  `a3-server-00`.
- After the user completed the check and stopped the deployment, the XR returned
  to Stopped/Synced/Ready with no runtime resources. The Ray Composition worker
  readiness override was then released while stopped and takes effect on the
  next Start.

The Model Deployment Dashboard candidate was not applied during this recovery.
