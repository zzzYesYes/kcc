# Crossplane control plane

This directory records the production Crossplane control-plane bootstrap for
the model platform.

## Current production boundary

- Crossplane Core and RBAC Manager run as one replica each on `server-00`.
- Function Patch and Transform `v0.8.2` and the pinned
  `provider-kubernetes:v1.0.0` package are installed by immutable digest and
  are Healthy. The provider runtime is pinned to `server-00` and requests no
  accelerator.
- The control-plane-only foundation (`foundation/kustomization.yaml`) is
  applied: provider ServiceAccount/namespace Role+RoleBinding,
  `DeploymentRuntimeConfig`, the ModelDeployment XRD and the reviewed Qwen3.8
  Composition are registered. The foundation itself creates no managed
  runtime; the separate provider release creates only the control-plane
  provider Pod.
- Package and function caches use bounded, disposable `emptyDir` volumes.
- No PVC, NPU Pod, RayService or model-cache Job is created in this phase.
  Production contains exactly one stopped `ModelDeployment` proof instance.
- `ModelDeployment` is a namespaced platform API. Its XRD constrains user input
  to the currently verified Qwen references, `Stopped` and
  `control-plane-only`; it deliberately exposes no image, command, physical
  NPU ID or arbitrary resource values.

The installed Pipeline-mode `runtime-zero` Composition creates a status
ConfigMap, ClusterIP Service and an exact dormant runtime Deployment. The
Deployment is continuously reconciled to `replicas: 0`, so it creates no Pod
and performs no NPU allocation. It also creates no PVC, cache Job, RayCluster
or RayService. Runtime activation remains a separate NPU-gated phase.

For the focused Qwen3.8-27B rollout, Crossplane is now an explicit runtime
composition layer. Argo CD remains the CD executor and submits a
`ModelDeployment` XR; the installed pinned `provider-kubernetes` plus its
namespaced ProviderConfig/ServiceAccount will create the cache PVC/Job,
stopped/Running RayService, Service and policies only after that XR is
approved. KubeRay then owns the RayService lifecycle.
The current control-plane Composition is selected by the stopped Qwen3.8 XR
and creates only its status ConfigMap. The Qwen3.8 runtime Composition remains
registered as a separately reviewed extension and is not selected while the XR
is stopped. See `foundation-deployment-record-20260818.md` and
`../qwen38-ray-mvp-plan-20260818.md` for the provider, RBAC, cache gate and
composition sequence.

The reusable first-stage source now lives in
`provider-kubernetes/` (RuntimeConfig, namespaced ProviderConfig, target Role/
RoleBinding and a non-applied package example) and
`composition/modeldeployment-qwen38-ray.yaml`. These files are intentionally
not included in the existing Argo bootstrap Application. The new
`foundation/kustomization.yaml` is the control-plane-only release unit for the
ServiceAccount/Role/RoleBinding, DeploymentRuntimeConfig, XRD and Composition;
it deliberately creates no Provider, ProviderConfig, PVC, cache Job, RayService
or Service; Provider and ProviderConfig are applied as a separately audited
release unit.
The provider package digest, Artifact Keeper cache/runtime image digests and
node-local StorageClass/PV evidence remain separate release gates.

## Pinned inputs

- Crossplane and chart: `2.3.4`
- Chart checksum and source image digests: `versions.lock.yaml`
- Runtime image: the internal registry image pinned by Linux/AMD64 manifest
  digest in `values-production.yaml`
- Function Patch and Transform: `v0.8.2`, with upstream index and Linux/AMD64
  package digests pinned in `versions.lock.yaml`
- Artifact Keeper Function manifest:
  `sha256:070fd3bdb56ec93f825e2f8fcda902bbdaef2e7831e164be5311144867f51dd8`

## Released package path

Crossplane Core resolves the Function package over the cluster-internal HTTPS
name `artifact-keeper-registry.artifact-keeper.svc.cluster.local`, using the CA
from `artifact-keeper-registry-ca`. The Function runtime itself is pulled by
K3s containerd from `110.120.0.3:30670/container-images` with a namespace-local
read-only pull Secret. This split is intentional: Crossplane Core does not use
the node containerd insecure-registry configuration when resolving packages.
The provider runtime follows the same split: its xpkg is resolved over the
internal route, while its controller image is explicitly pinned to the
`110.120.0.3:30670` node endpoint in `provider-kubernetes/runtime-config.yaml`.

The released instance and complete evidence are recorded in
`runtime-zero-deployment-record-20260814.md`.

The aggregate ClusterRoles are necessarily cluster-scoped because Crossplane's
primary controller role is cluster-scoped. The existing runtime-zero roles grant
only ConfigMaps, Deployments and Services. The installed Qwen3.8 Provider uses a
separate ServiceAccount/Role limited to `model-serving`; it adds only the
namespaced permissions for PVC, Job, Service, policy objects and
`ray.io/RayService`. It will not manage PV/StorageClass, nodes, Device Plugin,
other namespaces or existing Ray objects.

## Qwen3.8 Provider and Composition boundary

The provider package and namespaced ProviderConfig are installed and audited.
The first Qwen3.8 ModelDeployment XR is stopped and control-plane-only; this
section does not authorize model download, quantization, cache creation or an
NPU window.

```text
Argo Application
  -> ModelDeployment XR (model-serving)
  -> Crossplane Composition
  -> provider-kubernetes ProviderConfig
  -> PVC + zero-NPU cache Job + stopped RayService + Service/NetworkPolicy
  -> cache READY + desiredState=Running
  -> RayService worker=1
  -> existing KubeRay v1.6.0
```

Required release units:

1. Lock the provider-kubernetes package and mirror its controller image to
   Artifact Keeper; schedule the provider on `server-00` with no NPU request.
   **Completed 2026-08-19.**
2. Create a ProviderConfig with in-cluster credentials and a dedicated
   ServiceAccount/Role/RoleBinding scoped to `model-serving`.
   **Completed 2026-08-19.**
3. Extend the namespaced ModelDeployment XRD with allow-listed Qwen3.8 refs and
   `Running` while preserving the existing stopped/control-plane behavior.
   **Completed 2026-08-19; the structural schema was re-applied and verified.**
4. Add a Composition that renders provider Objects for the cache PVC, cache Job,
   RayService, Service, NetworkPolicy, Quota and status conditions.
   **Runtime Composition registered; not selected by the stopped XR.**
5. Keep the RayService worker replicas at zero until the cache Job is Complete and
   `READY` is verified; then change the XR desired state through Git/Argo.
6. First validate with a stopped XR and harmless namespaced object; only then allow
   the composition to request the 8 NPU worker.

## Validation sequence

```bash
helm lint crossplane-2.3.4.tgz \
  --values app/model_platform/crossplane/values-production.yaml

helm template crossplane crossplane-2.3.4.tgz \
  --namespace crossplane-system \
  --values app/model_platform/crossplane/values-production.yaml

kubectl apply --dry-run=server \
  -f app/model_platform/crossplane/namespace.yaml
```

After Core is Ready, validate and apply the XRD separately. Crossplane installs
its own core CRDs during the init phase, so the XRD cannot pass server-side
validation before Core has registered `CompositeResourceDefinition`.
